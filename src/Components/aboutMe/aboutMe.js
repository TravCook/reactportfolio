        I am a full-stack web developer who is currently an instruction specialist at the full-stack bootcamp by Trilogy/2U education through the Georgia Institute of Technology. Thanks to this experience I am well versed in many front-end and back-end languages. When I am not working with students, I am working on some of my side coding projects, and watching sports like baseball, hockey, or the premier league.
